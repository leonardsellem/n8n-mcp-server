### Key Technical Breakthroughs

#### AI Agent Connection Architecture ✅
```
OpenAI Chat Model 
    ↓ (ai_languageModel connection)
AI Agent ← (ai_tool connections from Outlook nodes)
    ↓ (main output)
Teams Response
```

#### Smart AI Tool Integration ✅
All Outlook operations connect as AI tools using the special `ai_tool` connection type:
- Outlook Email Reader → AI Agent (ai_tool)
- Outlook Email Sender → AI Agent (ai_tool) 
- Outlook Calendar → AI Agent (ai_tool)
- Email Draft Manager → AI Agent (ai_tool)
- And more...

#### Natural Language Processing Flow ✅

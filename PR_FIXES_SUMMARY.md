- Added sum, average, min, max, count operations
- Added rounding with decimal places
- Removed fake API requirements

### 3. Aggregate Node (`src/data/nodes/core/aggregate-node.ts`)
**Problem**: Had fake API operations instead of data aggregation
**Solution**:
- Implemented proper data aggregation modes
- Added "Individual Fields" and "All Item Data" options
- Added field selection and renaming capabilities
- Added aggregation options (null handling, array merging)
- Removed fake API requirements

### 4. Sort Node (`src/data/nodes/core/sort-node.ts`)
**Problem**: Had fake API credentials instead of sorting functionality

- Added date part extraction (year, month, day, etc.)
- Added current time generation
- Removed fake API requirements

### 6. Split Out Node (`src/data/nodes/core/split-out-node.ts`)
**Problem**: Had fake API operations instead of array splitting
**Solution**:

## ðŸŽ‰ Result Summary

All core node definitions now have:
- âœ… **Proper functionality** instead of fake API calls
- âœ… **Realistic parameters** that match actual n8n behavior
- âœ… **Comprehensive examples** showing real usage patterns
- âœ… **Correct categorization** (Core Nodes vs random categories)

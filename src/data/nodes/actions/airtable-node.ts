 * **Status**: âœ… Active
 * **Category**: Action Nodes
 * **Subcategory**: Productivity & Collaboration
 * 
 * ## Description
 * 
 * Use the Airtable node to automate work in Airtable, and integrate Airtable with other applications. 
 * n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Airtable features, including creating, reading, listing, 
 * updating and deleting tables.
 * 
 * ## Key Features
 * 
 * - **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete records in Airtable bases
 * - **Advanced Filtering**: Use Airtable's formula system for complex record filtering
 * - **Bulk Operations**: Handle multiple records efficiently with list and batch operations
 * - **Field Type Support**: Work with all Airtable field types (text, number, date, attachment, etc.)
 * - **Record ID Management**: Get and use Record IDs for precise record targeting
 * - **Formula Integration**: Leverage Airtable's powerful formula system for data manipulation
 * - **Base and Table Management**: Work across multiple bases and tables in your workspace
 * - **Real-time Sync**: Integration with Airtable's real-time collaboration features
 * - **Attachment Handling**: Upload and manage file attachments in records
 * - **View Integration**: Work with specific views and their filtered data
 * - **API Rate Limiting**: Built-in handling of Airtable's API rate limits
 * - **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity with Airtable's field validation rules
 * 
 * ## Credentials
 * 
 * Refer to [Airtable credentials](../../credentials/airtable/) for guidance on setting up authentication.
 * Uses Airtable Personal Access Tokens or API keys for secure access to your bases.
 * 
 * ## Operations
 * 
 * - **Append**: Append new data to a table (create new records)
 * - **Delete**: Delete records from a table
 * - **List**: List and filter records from a table
 * - **Read**: Read specific records from a table
 * - **Update**: Update existing records in a table
 * 
 * ## Working with Record IDs
 * 
 * ### Getting Record IDs
 * 
 * To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two main approaches:
 * 
 * #### Method 1: Create a Record ID Column
 * Create a `Record ID` column in your Airtable table to display Record IDs directly. 
 * This makes it easy to reference specific records in your workflows.
 * 
 * #### Method 2: Use the List Operation
 * Use the **List** operation to retrieve Record IDs along with other field data. 
 * This operation returns the Record ID for each record, which you can then use 
 * in subsequent operations.
 * 
 * ## Advanced Filtering
 * 
 * ### Filter By Formula
 * 
 * Use Airtable's powerful formula system to filter records when using the List operation:
 * 
 * #### Examples:
 * - **Filter by organization**: `{Organization}='n8n'`
 * - **Exclude organization**: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`
 * - **Filter by date range**: `AND({Date} >= '2024-01-01', {Date} <= '2024-12-31')`
 * - **Filter by status**: `OR({Status}='Active', {Status}='Pending')`
 * - **Complex conditions**: `AND({Priority}='High', NOT({Assigned}=''))`
 * 
 * Refer to Airtable's formula documentation for complete syntax and available functions.
 * 
 * ## Related Resources
 * 
 * Refer to [Airtable's API documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for more information about the service.
 * n8n provides a trigger node for Airtable to receive webhook notifications about record changes.
 * 
 * ## Custom API Operations
 * 
 * If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the HTTP Request node 
 * to call the Airtable API directly with your Airtable credentials.
 * 
 * ## Common Issues & Solutions
 * 
 * For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to the Common Issues documentation.
 * Common challenges include Record ID management, formula syntax, and field type compatibility.
 * 
 * ## Use Cases
 * 
 * - **Project Management**: Task tracking, milestone management, and team collaboration
 * - **Customer Relationship Management**: Lead tracking, customer data management, and sales pipelines
 * - **Content Management**: Editorial calendars, content planning, and publication workflows

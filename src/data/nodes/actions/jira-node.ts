 * - **Text Search**: `summary ~ "bug"`
 * 
 * #### Advanced JQL Features
 * - **Multiple Conditions**: `project = "KEY" AND status = "Open"`
 * - **OR Logic**: `priority = High OR priority = Critical`
 * - **Negation**: `assignee != currentUser()`
 * - **Functions**: `duedate < now()`
 * - **Ordering**: `ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC`
 * 
 * ### Custom Field Support
 * - **Field Types**: Support for all Jira custom field types
 * - **Field Querying**: Query and filter by custom field values

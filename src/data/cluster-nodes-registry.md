- Load balancing nodes
- Task distribution nodes
- Queue management nodes

### Multi-Instance Coordination
- Instance communication nodes
- State synchronization nodes
- Resource sharing nodes
- Failover management nodes

### Performance Optimization
- Caching nodes
- Resource pooling nodes
- Batch processing nodes
- Memory management nodes

## Cluster Nodes Documentation

*Cluster nodes are specialized components for enterprise-scale n8n deployments. These nodes handle distributed processing, load balancing, and cross-instance coordination.*

### Key Features:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute workload across multiple n8n instances
- **High Availability**: Implement failover and redundancy mechanisms
- **Resource Management**: Optimize memory, CPU, and network usage
- **State Coordination**: Synchronize data across distributed instances
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track cluster health and performance metrics

### Use Cases:
- **Enterprise Workflows**: Large-scale business process automation
- **High-Volume Processing**: Handle thousands of concurrent workflows
- **Mission-Critical Systems**: Ensure 99.9%+ uptime requirements
- **Resource-Intensive Tasks**: Distribute computational workloads
- **Multi-Tenant Environments**: Isolate and scale per-tenant workloads

## Cluster Nodes To Be Documented

### Core Cluster Nodes:
1. **Cluster Manager** - Central coordination and management
2. **Load Balancer** - Distribute incoming requests across instances
3. **State Synchronizer** - Keep workflow state consistent across cluster
4. **Resource Monitor** - Track and optimize cluster resource usage
5. **Failover Controller** - Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms

### Advanced Cluster Features:
1. **Queue Manager** - Distributed task queuing and processing
2. **Cache Coordinator** - Shared caching across cluster instances
3. **Health Monitor** - Cluster-wide health checking and reporting
4. **Auto Scaler** - Dynamic scaling based on workload
5. **Data Partitioner** - Distribute data processing across nodes

### Integration Cluster Nodes:
1. **Database Cluster** - Distributed database operations
2. **Message Queue Cluster** - Distributed messaging systems
3. **Storage Cluster** - Distributed file and object storage
4. **API Gateway Cluster** - Distributed API management
5. **Cache Cluster** - Distributed caching solutions

*Note: Cluster nodes are typically available in n8n Enterprise editions and require specific configuration for distributed deployments. This registry will be expanded with detailed technical specifications and deployment guides.*

## Enterprise Features

### Prerequisites:
- n8n Enterprise license
- Multi-instance deployment architecture
- Shared database configuration
- Network connectivity between instances
- Load balancer configuration

### Configuration Requirements:
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL or MySQL instance
- **Redis**: Shared Redis instance for caching and queues
- **File Storage**: Shared file system or object storage
- **Network**: Secure communication between cluster nodes
- **Monitoring**: Centralized logging and metrics collection

### Performance Considerations:
- **Latency**: Network latency between cluster nodes
- **Throughput**: Maximum concurrent workflow executions
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling limits and bottlenecks
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU requirements per node
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency vs strong consistency

*This documentation will be expanded as more cluster node information becomes available through systematic documentation of the n8n cluster architecture.*
